# QBIO7004 - Individual-based Model Project

This repository contains R code to produce an individual-based model and accompanying report. The project simulates the complex interactions among prey, predators, and their environment, specifically focusing on sheep, wolves, and grass.

R version R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) was used for all code contained within this repository.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following R packages installed:

-   `plotrix`

-   `ggplot2`

-   `tidyverse`

-   `animation`

You can install them using the following commands:

``` r
install.packages("plotrix")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.package("tidyverse")
install.package("animation")
```

## Code

R script provides all the code to generate the simulation of the model.

## Plots

The plots are stored in the "Plots/" directory and include the following files:

-   **simulation_movie.gif**: This file runs through all 60 time steps of the simulation.

-   **lineplot.png**: This file tracks the populations of wolves and sheep, as well as the amount of grass, over time.

-   **assignment_model.png**: This file provides a graphical summary of the model.

## Report

The RMarkdown file provides instructions for creating a reproducible report for this model. The report includes a reference file stored in references.bib, and the reference style used is APA (7th edition).
